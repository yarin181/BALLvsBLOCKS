## How to Run

To run the game, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. Once you have the JDK installed, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the project to your machine.
2.  Open the source code in an IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
3.  Run the `Ass6Game` class, which is located in the src directory of the project.
4.  When running the game, you can specify the levels you want to play by passing their numbers as command line arguments. For example, to play levels 1 and 3, you can run the command `java Ass6Game 1 3`.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to use a paddle to bounce a ball and break all the blocks at each level. The player has three lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost.

Each block has a different number of hits required to break it, and some blocks may contain power-ups or obstacles that affect the gameplay.

## Levels

The game has four different levels, each with a unique layout and set of challenges. The levels are as follows:

-   Level 1: Direct Hit
-   Level 2: Party
-   Level 3: Big Final
